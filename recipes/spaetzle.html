     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>
        Apparently spätzle (aka spaetzle) translates to little swallows in German, which makes a lot of sense when you consider their shape. This recipe for micro-dumplings cooks in a just a few minutes. They're great plain with browned butter or topped with slowly braised meat.

     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <p>
        <ul>
            <l1>½ cup all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</l1>
            <l2>3 tablespoons milk, or as needed</l2>
            <l3>1 large egg</l3>
            <l4>1 tablespoon crème fraîche, sour cream, or plain yogurt</l4>
            <l5>½ teaspoon kosher salt</l5>
            <l6>1 pinch cayenne pepper</l6>
        </ul>
     </p>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <l1>Whisk flour, milk, egg, crème fraîche, salt, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl until batter drips slowly off whisk. Add a bit more flour if batter seems too thin; add a bit more milk if batter seems too thick.</l1>
        <l2>Bring a large pot of salted water to a simmer over medium-high heat. Push a spoonful of batter into the simmering water through the smooth side of a cheese grater with fairly large holes using a spatula.</l2>
        <l3>Cook spätzle in batches until they rise to water's surface, about 3 minutes. Remove spätzle with a slotted spoon. Repeat with remaining batter.</l3>
     </ol>
