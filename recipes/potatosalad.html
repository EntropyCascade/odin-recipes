     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>
        This is my mother's recipe for authentic German potato salad. Everyone, German or not, loves it. It is easy to double the recipe as well. I often bring it to potlucks, and we also have it at home on special occasions. There are usually no leftovers, but if there are, they don't last long!
